thick, flat plates with irregular edges
thread-like structures with irregular shapes
fibrous networks with branching patterns
thin, delicate filaments with nodes
swelling star phenotype, swelling spores with several germination tubes around
swelling, round, larger than usual
isolated spores, some overlap possible
very short, at most one branching event
several tubes per spore, tubes grow from a few localized positions on spore surface, often two germination events at 180 degree
curly germination phenotype, chaotic germination tube growth
round, smaller than usual, often hidden by tubes
rather isolated, with a clear tendency to form clusters
curly, with several branching events, short
several tubes per spore, tubes distribution and growth is chaotic, tubes tend to create agglomerates around the spore
mycelium growth, branching structures, no compound effect
small and round, often hard to detect because covered by branching tubes
spores exist only as a part of a very large overlapping branching structure
extremely long, with several branching events, growing rather linearly with possibly some irregular curly patterns
all tubes branch, overlap and connect, growing very far out of their original spore, creating a branching structure with rather stable density across the whole image
only spores, no germ tube growth
round, small, of rather uniform size and shape
isolated spores, very little overlap
extremely short to non-existent, no branching events, straight
zero to one tube per spore
pearl necklace phenotype, germination tubes look like pebbles
round, large
isolated spores, some overlap possible
tubes look like a line of pebbles along a necklace, short, thicker than usual
one or two tubes per spore, growing from opposite points on the spore surface, at most one branching event
swelling spores of different shapes, from round to ovoidal, irregular distribution of germination tubes
swelling, variable shape and size, some spores are ovoidal
isolated spores, some overlap possible
short, can have more than one branching event, can be either straight or curly
two to several tubes per spore, tubes grow from a few localized points irregularly distributed on the spore surface
